Welcome to the BYU Mars Rover 2014 Base Station Control Software

External libraries for Xbox controller input and serial communication were used in this project and can be found here:
http://www.aplu.ch/home/apluhomex.jsp?site=36
http://mfizz.com/oss/rxtx-for-java
these resources take the form of the jar files and dlls in this project folder

To run (finish this):
1) put the .dll files in the C:/Windows folder (or perhaps in the java installation's jre.x.x/bin folder, I haven't tried this yet though)
2) plug in your xbox controller to install the driver for it.

Note: the computer I used was 64 bit
