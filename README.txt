Welcome to the BYU Mars Rover 2014 Base Station Control Software

External libraries for Xbox controller input and serial communication were used in this project and can be found here:

http://mfizz.com/oss/rxtx-for-java
these resources take the form of the jar files and dlls in this project folder

See INSTRUCTIONS.txt for instructions on running the program

Development of this project got more and more rushed as the competition neared, including a major last minute change to try to switch the output from udp to serial to bypass the fried master control board on the rover

Note: the computer I used was 64 bit

Another important note: for some reason the xbox controller and the serial libraries don't play nice, so when you run this, be sure to press a button on the xbox controller first to activate it and then hit f11 (I'm pretty sure that's right) to activate serial communications
